# Risk of Diabetes- Statistical analysis of comorbidity and leading physiological and demographic factors

#### -- Project Status: Completed

### Project Description

This project examines the risk of diagnosis of diabetes by analyzing physiological health metrics and demographic factors including Glycohemoglobin levels, Blood Urea levels, BMI, Age and Ethnicity of individuals with methods including logistic regression, HCA Heatmap, Classification tree and accuracy analysis. Our findings and present literature indicates that these factors significantly contribute in increasing the risk of diagnosis of diabetes, highlighting the complex and substantial role of presence of chronic diseases and demographic conditions. The presence of chronic diseases such as chronic kidney diseases, obesity and cardiovascular disease contribute in increasing the risk of diabetes and can lead to comorbidity of multiple conditions. This project aims at understanding this relationship and classifying the risk of diabetes in a selected population.
